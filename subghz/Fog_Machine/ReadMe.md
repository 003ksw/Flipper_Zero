I've found that this company makes most fog machines internal componants and sells to many manufacturers. 
Global Special Effects, Fog Masters, Chauvet, American DJ, Eliminator, Magmatic, are all the same remote.
This uses a standard C-13/C-14 connector like a PC power cord.

I haven't found a fog machine with any other rf remote than this one. So have fun.
